# Functions of Chords

|Feel|Chord ->| Next chord|
|:-----|:------------|:----------------|
|Stable. Feels like “home”. Great to start on.|I|Any|
|Movement. Creates a feeling of change, wants to move somewhere else.|II|V or VII|
|Stable. Less stable than the I chord.|III|VI|
|Movement. Creates a feeling of change, wants to move somewhere else.|IV|V or VII|
|Tension. Wants to move somewhere else fast. Great to end on.|V|I or III|
|Stable. Less stable than the I chord.|VI|II or IV|
|Tension. Wants to move somewhere else fast.|VII|I or III|

|Chord ->            | Next chord             |
|:-----------------|:--------------------------------|
|I|Any|
|II|V or VII|
|III|VI|
|IV|V or VII|
|V|I or III|
|VI|II or IV|
|VII|I or III|

## Common Chord Progressions

|Progression     | In the key of C Major, this progression is:        |
|:--------------------------|:--------------------------------|
|I → V → VI → IV| C – G – am – F|
|I → V → IV → V|C – G – F – G|
|I → VI → IV → V|C – am – F – G|
|I → IV → VI → V|C – F – am – G|
|I → V → VI → III → IV|C – G – am – em – F|

Are these the only chord changes you can make? Of course not. These rules tell you where a chord sounds like it should go next. On the other hand, you may want to tease the listener and don’t want the progression to resolve right away. These rules are a great starting point, but always make decisions in context.

Diatonic Triads:
Every key has seven diatonic triads. These chords naturally occur in the key.
There is a formula to find the diatonic triads of major/minor keys.

Chord Progressions:
An easy way to build a chord progression is to create a 4 bar loop with 1 chord per bar.
Chord progressions need a logical start/finish, and should have a degree of development and movement.
Each chord in a key serves a unique purpose: some are stable, some are tense, others are restless.
Chord progressions tend to a follow a certain pattern. There are rules that explain common chord movements (for example: V -> I always sounds good).
Using all of this information, you will be well on your way to writing stronger and catchier chord progressions.


The chords in diatonic harmony only come in a few different flavors. Major, minor and dimished.

In major diatonic harmony, the chords are:

I – Major
	ii – minor
		iii – minor
			IV – Major
				V – Major
					vi – minor
						vii – diminished

In minor diatonic harmony, the chords are:
i – minor
ii – diminished
III – Major
iv – minor
V – Major
VI – Major
vii – diminished
You can pick up on a few things from this.
The Major chords are written in capitals, minor chords and diminished in lowercase. You also frequently see M for major and m for minor.
The tonality for the most part flip flops for the scales. I becomes i, iii becomes III, vi becomes VI. V and vii don’t really change, and that is because the of the leading tone remaining a half step above. It is also important to to point out that the III uses a lowered 7th tone, also known as the sub-tonic.
