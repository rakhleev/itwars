# Chords

A chord is a combination of two or more unique notes. There are several different chord types, and each chord type has a particular sound.

##Chord Types

There are 9 common chord qualities that you should be aware of. Some of these aren’t used often, while others are used extensively:

1. Major
2. Minor
3. Diminished
4. Major Seventh
5. Minor Seventh
6. Dominant Seventh
7. Suspended
8. Augmented
9. Extended

# Major Chords

Major chords sound happy and simple.

A major chord consists of a root note |1st|, a major third |+4 semitones|, and a perfect 5th |+7 semitones|.

## Major Codes

How to Use the Codes:

- Pick any key on your keyboard piano-
This is your Zero Point
- Starting at Zero, simply count up the
keyboard to complete the given code

> ^=Note Raised one octave

## Advanced Major Chords

### Major Seventh Chord
Major seventh chords are considered to be thoughtful, soft. Major seventh chords also sound “jazzy” because they’re commonly used in Jazz.

A major seventh chord consists of a root note |1st|, a major third |+4 semitones|, a perfect 5th |+7 semitones|, and a major 7th |+11 semitones|. Another way to think about major seventh chords is they are a major triad |i.e. major chord| with a major 7th on top.

### Dominant Seventh

Dominant seventh chords are considered to be strong and restless. Dominant seventh chords are commonly found in jazz and blues, as well as jazz-inspired r&b, hip hop, & EDM.

A dominant seventh chord consists of a root note |1st|, a major third |+4 semitones|, a perfect 5th |+7 semitones|, and a minor 7th |+10 semitones|. Another way to think about major seventh chords is they are a major seventh chord with the top note lowered by one semitone.

### Dominant Ninth

The dominant ninth nine chord consists of a root, major 3rd (+4 semitones), perfect 5th (+ 7 semitones), minor/flat 7th (+10 semitones), and major 9th (+14 semitones).

### Major Eleventh

A major eleventh chord consists of a root note (1st), a major third (+4 semitones), a perfect 5th (+7 semitones), a major 7th (+11 semitones), a major 9th (+14 semitones), and an 11th (+17 semitones).

#Minor Chords

Minor chords are considered to be sad, or ‘serious.’

A minor chord consists of a root note |1st|, a minor third |+3 semitones|, and a perfect 5th |+7 semitones|.


## Minor Seventh

Minor seventh chords are considered to be moody, or contemplative. If major chords are happy, and minor chords are sad, then minor seventh chords are somewhere in between these two.

A minor seventh chord consists of a root note |1st|, a minor third |+3 semitones|, a perfect 5th |+7 semitones|, and a minor 7th |+10 semitones|. Another way to think about minor seventh chords is they are a minor triad with a minor 7th on top.

## Diminished Chords

Diminished Chords sound tense and unpleasant.

A diminished chord consists of a root note |1st|, a minor third |+3 semitones|, and a diminished/flat fifth |+6 semitones|.

Diminished chords aren’t used too often, but they still serve an important purpose. Later, we’ll discuss why and where you can use diminished chords.

### Diminished Codes

|Chord                   |              Codes               |

|Half-Diminished 7th |0-3-6-10|
|Leading Tone |0-3-6|
|Secondary Leading Tone |0-3-6|



## Augmented Chords

Augmented chords sound anxious and suspenseful.

An augmented chord consists of a root note |1st|, a major third |+4 semitones|, and an augmented 5th |+8 semitones|. Another way to think about augmented chords is they are a major chord with the top note raised one semitone.

> augmented = raised, so an augmented 5th is a 5th raised by one semitone.

# Functions of Chords

## What role does each chord serve in the key?

Within each key, there are seven diatonic triads to choose from. Each chord serves a distinct purpose: some will sound like “home”, some will sound suspenseful, and others will sound happy but anxious.

Without getting too technical, let’s discuss the role of each chord in a major key:

|#                  |              Feel              |Chord ->            | Next chord             |
|:--------------------------|:--------------------------------|:-----------------|:--------------------------------|
|I|Stable. Feels like “home”. Great to start on.|I|Any|
|II|Movement. Creates a feeling of change, wants to move somewhere else.|II|V or VII|
|III|Stable. Less stable than the I chord.|III|VI|
|IV|Movement. Creates a feeling of change, wants to move somewhere else.|IV|V or VII|
|V|Tension. Wants to move somewhere else fast. Great to end on.|V|I or III|
|VI|Stable. Less stable than the I chord.|VI|II or IV|
|VII|Tension. Wants to move somewhere else fast.|VII|I or III|

> Example: Start with the one chord, which feels like home. Move to the six chord, which is stable but a bit tense. Move to the two chord, which creates a sense of change. End on the five chord, which wants to be resolved back to the one (start).

These aren’t steadfast rules, but they are a great starting point.

## How do chords sound when played one after the other?

When you combine chords in a progression, certain arrangements will sound better than others. Some chords sound great played together, while others sound just okay. Thankfully, there are guidelines that tell you which chord should come next.

Let’s look at the common chord motion in a major key (i.e. what chord will sound good next).

|Chord ->            | Next chord             |
|:-----------------|:--------------------------------|
|I|Any|
|II|V or VII|
|III|VI|
|IV|V or VII|
|V|I or III|
|VI|II or IV|
|VII|I or III|

## Common Chord Progressions

|Progression     | In the key of C Major, this progression is:        |
|:--------------------------|:--------------------------------|
|I → V → VI → IV| C – G – am – F|
|I → V → IV → V|C – G – F – G|
|I → VI → IV → V|C – am – F – G|
|I → IV → VI → V|C – F – am – G|
|I → V → VI → III → IV|C – G – am – em – F|

Are these the only chord changes you can make? Of course not. These rules tell you where a chord sounds like it should go next. On the other hand, you may want to tease the listener and don’t want the progression to resolve right away. These rules are a great starting point, but always make decisions in context.

Diatonic Triads:
Every key has seven diatonic triads. These chords naturally occur in the key.
There is a formula to find the diatonic triads of major/minor keys.

Chord Progressions:
An easy way to build a chord progression is to create a 4 bar loop with 1 chord per bar.
Chord progressions need a logical start/finish, and should have a degree of development and movement.
Each chord in a key serves a unique purpose: some are stable, some are tense, others are restless.
Chord progressions tend to a follow a certain pattern. There are rules that explain common chord movements (for example: V -> I always sounds good).
Using all of this information, you will be well on your way to writing stronger and catchier chord progressions.
